Are you going to help build it?
Or just live in it?

# Blockchain Benefits

## Peer-to-Peer
No more middle men. 

You deal directly with the people you need to.

## Transparent
The history of the blockchain is public and can be audited by anyone to determine 'bad actors`.

## Decentralised
No central authority is in control of a Blockchain. 

None of this "Don't be Evil" BS...  Evil isn't an option.

# Blockchain Problems

## Scalability
Ridiculous operating costs, transaction fees and associated difficulties hinder most projects.

## Speed
If your 'solution' can only handle a handful of people using it globally... it's not viable.

## Security
Many flaws have surfaced with the two main consensus algorithms - PoW and PoS

# Enter Skycoin
## A New Vision

> Fulfil Satoshi's vision of a global electronic, peer-to-peer digital currency.

Born out of necessity, Skycoin started with a simple vision that has gradually expanded and evolved. 

It now includes a complete decentralised economy and a general purpose programming language, CX, which supports integration with the blockchain.s
